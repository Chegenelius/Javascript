Create a file named DataTypes.js and do the following:

1. Declare firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried, year variable and assign value to it and use the typeof operator to check different data types.  
2. Check if type of '10' is equal to 10  
3. Check if parseInt('9.8') is equal to 10  
4. Boolean value is either true or false.  
   1. Write three JavaScript statements which provide truthy value.  
   2. Write three JavaScript statements which provide falsy value.

   

5.  Figure out the result of the following expressions first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it by using console.log()  
   1. 4 \> 3 && 10 \< 12  
   2. 4 \> 3 && 10 \> 12  
   3. 4 \> 3 || 10 \< 12  
   4. 4 \> 3 || 10 \> 12  
   5. \!(4 \> 3\)  
   6. \!(4 \< 3\)  
   7. \!(false)  
   8. \!(4 \> 3 && 10 \< 12\)  
   9. \!(4 \> 3 && 10 \> 12\)  
   10. \!(4 \=== '4')

   

6.  Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and write another prompt for height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area \= 0.5 x b x h).  
     
7. Using prompt, get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years. It should be like:  
   

   Enter birth year: 1995  
   You are 25\. You are old enough to drive  
     
   Enter birth year: 2005  
   You are 15\. You will be allowed to drive after 3 years.

     
8. Declare a variable named challenge and assign it to an initial value '30 Days Of JavaScriptâ€™  
9. Change all the string characters to capital letters using toUpperCase() method  
10. Change all the string characters to lowercase letters using toLowerCase() method  
11. Cut (slice) out the first word of the string using slice()  
12. Slice out the phrase *Days Of JavaScript* from *30 Days Of JavaScript*.  
13. Check if the string contains a word Script using includes() method  
14. Use indexOf to determine the position of the first occurrence of a in 30 Days Of JavaScript  
15. Use lastIndexOf to determine the position of the last occurrence of a in 30 Days Of JavaScript.  
16. Use indexOf to find the position of the first occurrence of the word because in the following sentence:'You cannot end a sentence with because because because is a conjunction'  
17. Use startsWith() method with the string *30 Days Of JavaScript* and make the result true  
18. Use endsWith() method with the string *30 Days Of JavaScript* and make the result true  
19. Generate a random number between 0 and 100 inclusively.  
      
20.  Declare variables named a & b, assign them to numbers. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways  
* using if else  
* ternary operator  
21.  Declare a variable named scores, Write a code which can give grades to students according to theirs scores and log it to the console:  
    1. 80-100, A  
    2. 70-89, B  
    3. 60-69, C  
    4. 50-59, D  
    5. 0-49, F

N.B When you have multiple prompts in one file, comment most of them and leave only the one you want to test uncommented.
